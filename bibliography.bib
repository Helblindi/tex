abstract = {Abstract This paper concerns a new Lagrangian Discontinuous Galerkin-type method to solve 2D fluid flows on unstructured meshes. By using a basis of Bernstein polynomials of degree m in each triangle, we define a diffusion process which ensures positivity and stability of the scheme. The discontinuities of the physical variables at the interfaces between cells are solved with an acoustic Riemann solver. A remeshing/remapping process is performed with a particle method: the remapping is locally conservative and its accuracy can be adapted to the accuracy of the numerical method.

Here, it is combined with the a posteriori Multidimensional Optimal Order Detection (MOOD) limiting strategy to ensure robustness and stability at shock waves with piecewise linear spatial reconstruction. The ADER (Arbitrary high order schemes using DERivatives) approach is adopted to obtain second-order of accuracy in time. This strategy has been successfully tested in a hydrodynamics context and the present work aims at extending it to the case of hyperelasticity. Here, the hyperelasticity equations are written in the updated Lagrangian framework and the dedicated Lagrangian numerical scheme is derived in terms of nodal solver, Geometrical Conservation Law (GCL) compliance, subcell forces and compatible discretization. The Lagrangian numerical method is implemented in 3D under MPI parallelization framework allowing to handle genuinely large meshes. A relatively large set of numerical test cases is presented to assess the ability of the method to achieve effective second order of accuracy on smooth flows, maintaining an essentially non-oscillatory behavior and general robustness across discontinuities and ensuring at least physical admissibility of the solution where appropriate. Pure elastic neo-Hookean and non-linear materials are considered for our benchmark test problems in 2D and 3D. These test cases feature material bending, impact, compression, non-linear deformation and further bouncing/detaching motions.}

The goal is to reduce dissipation, especially for smooth flows. This is accomplished by multiple piecewise linear reconstructions of conserved quantities within the cell. The reconstruction is based upon gradients that are calculated at the nodes, a procedure that avoids the least-square solution of a large equation set for polynomial coefficients. Conservation and monotonicity are guaranteed by adjusting the gradients within each cell corner. Results are presented for a wide variety of test problems involving smooth and shock-dominated flows, fluids and solids, 2D and 3D configurations, as well as Lagrange, Eulerian, and ALE methods.}

abstract = {In this paper we present a new formulation of the artificial viscosity concept. Physical arguments for the origins of this term are given and a set of criteria that any proper functional form of the artificial viscosity should satisfy is enumerated. The first important property is that by definition a viscosity must always be dissipative, transferring kinetic energy into internal energy, and must never act as a false pressure. The artificial viscous force should be Galilean invariant and vary continuously as a function of the criterion used to determine compression and expansion, and remain zero for the latter case. These requirements significantly constrain the functional form that the artificial viscous force can have. In addition, an artificial viscosity should be able to distinguish between shock-wave and adiabatic compression, and not result in spurious entropy production when only the latter is present. It must therefore turn off completely for self-similiar motion, where only a uniform stretching and/or a rigid rotation occurs. An additional important, but more subtle, condition where the artificial viscosity should produce no effect is along the direction tangential to a convergent shock front, since the velocity is only discontinuous in the normal direction. Our principal result is the development of a new formulation of an edge-centered artificial viscosity that is to be used in conjunction with a staggered spatial placement of variables that meets all of these standards, and without the need for problem dependent numerical coefficients that have in the past made the artificial viscosity method appear somewhat arbitrary. Our formulation and numerical results are given with respect to two spatial dimensions but all of our arguments carry over directly to three dimensions. A central feature of our development is the implementation of simple advection limiters in a straightforward manner in more than one dimension to turn off the artificial viscosity for the above mentioned conditions, and to substantially reduce its effect when strong velocity gradients are absent.}

abstract = {The bane of Lagrangian hydrodynamics calculations is the premature breakdown of grid topology that results in severe degradation of accuracy and run termination often long before the assumption of a Lagrangian zonal mass has ceased to be valid. At short spatial grid scales this is usually referred to by the terms “hourglass” mode or “keystone” motion associated, in particular, with underconstrained grids such as quadrilaterals and hexahedrons in two and three dimensions, respectively. At longer spatial lengths relative to the grid spacing there is what is referred to ubiquitously as “spurious vorticity,” or the long-thin zone problem. In both cases the result is anomalous grid distortion and tangling that has nothing to do with the actual solution, as would be the case for turbulent flow. In this work we show how such motions can be eliminated by the proper use of subzonal Lagrangian masses, and associated densities and pressures. These subzonal pressures give rise to forces that resist these spurious motions. The pressure is no longer a constant in a zone; it now accurately reflects the density gradients that can occur within a zone due to its differential distortion. Subzonal Lagrangian masses can be choosen in more than one manner to obtain subzonal density and pressure variation. However, these masses arise in a natural way from the intersection of the Lagrangian contours, through which no mass flows, that are associated with both the Lagrangian zonal and nodal masses in a staggered spatial grid hydrodynamics formulation. This is an extension of the usual Lagrangian assumption that is often applied to only the zonal mass. We show that with a proper discretization of the subzonal forces resulting from subzonal pressures, hourglass motion and spurious vorticity can be eliminated for a very large range of problems.}

CAVEAT is written to treat a wide variety of problems. It has the ability, for example, to describe material interfaces and the large slip along interfaces, to describe complex geometries without sacrificing vector processing, and to apply tabular equations of state. Its numerical methods were chosen to minimize numerical diffusion, achieve a high degree of vectorization, and facilitate extension to three dimensions. CAVEAT uses an explicit time-marching, conservative finite-volume numerical technique in which all state variables, including velocity, are cell centered; values at vertices and cell faces are derived. The technique is a variation of the Godunov method that uses an approximate Riemann solver and accommodates arbitrary equations of state. Spatial differencing may either be first order or second order with a choice of limiters of the gradient in an attempt to preserve monotonicity. The formulation is spatially two-dimensional with options for Cartesian and curvilinear geometries. Discretization is achieved with a mesh of arbitrary quadrilateral cells whose vertices can move with time. Arbitrary mesh motion is supported by allowing transport of material between cells according to the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian technique. This report is a second edition of an earlier report on CAVEAT. Because of the maturity and expanded use of CAVEAT, this report includes new sections directed toward first-time users.

In this paper, a generalized hyperelastic model for anisotropic materials with large nonlinear elastic deformations is formulated and proposed. A strain energy function for the model is proposed and decomposed into an isotropic part and an anisotropic part which allows for a variety of combinations of isotropic and anisotropic functions. The model is formulated based on the framework of the invariant theory as well as polyconvexity and coercivity conditions. The proposed strain energy function includes the invariants important when materials are in a compressive state. In order to show the potential capability of the model, it is applied to predicting the highly nonlinear elastic and anisotropic behavior under incompressibility constraint of soft tissues subjected to different load patterns including compression.

The main purpose of this work is to demonstrate our claim in [3] that the accuracy degeneracy phenomenon observed for the high order Lagrangian type scheme is due to the error from the quadrilateral mesh with straight-line edges, which restricts the accuracy of the resulting scheme to at most second order. The accuracy test given in this paper shows that the third order Lagrangian type scheme can actually obtain uniformly third order accuracy even on distorted meshes by using curvilinear meshes.

abstract = {Robustness of numerical methods has attracted an increasing interest in the community of computational fluid dynamics. One mathematical aspect of robustness for numerical methods is the positivity-preserving property. At high Mach numbers or for flows near vacuum, solving the conservative Euler equations may generate negative density or internal energy numerically, which may lead to nonlinear instability and crash of the code. This difficulty is particularly profound for high order methods, for multi-material flows and for problems with moving meshes, such as the Lagrangian methods. In this paper, we construct both first order and uniformly high order accurate conservative Lagrangian schemes which preserve positivity of physically positive variables such as density and internal energy in the simulation of compressible multi-material flows with general equations of state (EOS). We first develop a positivity-preserving approximate Riemann solver for the Lagrangian scheme solving compressible Euler equations with both ideal and non-ideal EOS. Then we design a class of high order positivity-preserving and conservative Lagrangian schemes by using the essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) reconstruction, the strong stability preserving (SSP) high order time discretizations and the positivity-preserving scaling limiter which can be proven to maintain conservation and uniformly high order accuracy and is easy to implement. One-dimensional and two-dimensional numerical tests for the positivity-preserving Lagrangian schemes are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods.},

In this paper we present the method in a system of equations, stressing the point of how to use the weak form in the component spaces, but to use the local projection limiting in the characteristic fields, and how to implement boundary conditions. A 1-dimensional system is thus chosen as a model. Different implementation techniques are discussed, theories analogous to scalar cases are proven for linear systems, and numerical results are given illustrating the method on nonlinear systems. Discussions of handling complicated geometries via adaptive triangle elements will appear in future papers.}

abstract = {The Gilmore model is combined with the Noble-Abel-stiffened-gas (NASG) equation of state to yield a simple model to predict the expansion and collapse of spherical bubbles based on real gas thermodynamics. The NASG equation of state resolves the temperature inaccuracy associated with the commonly employed Tait equation of state for liquids and, thus, can provide a consistent description of compressible and thermal effects of the bubble content and the surrounding liquid during cavitation. After a detailed derivation of the proposed Gilmore-NASG model, the differences between the classical Gilmore-Tait model and the proposed model are highlighted with results of single-bubble cavitation related to bubble collapse and driven by an acoustic excitation in frequency and amplitude regimes relevant to sonoluminescence, high-intensity focused ultrasound and shock wave lithotripsy. Especially for rapidly and violently collapsing bubbles, substantial differences in the bubble behaviour can be observed between the proposed Gilmore-NASG model and the classical Gilmore-Tait model. The ability of the Gilmore-NASG model to simultaneously predict reliable pressure and temperature values in gas, vapour and liquid, makes the proposed model particularly attractive for sonochemistry and biomedical applications.}

abstract = {We investigate the apparent paradox, as exemplified by the well-known Saltzman test problem, of multidimensional lagrangian codes experiencing mesh tangling when computing one-dimensional irrotational flows. We demonstrate that the cause is the generation of spurious vorticity, or vorticity error, by a nonuniform mesh. Based on this, we investigate two methods of constructing improved lagrangian vertex velocities by removing, or filtering out, this spurious vorticity, rather than by the more common practice of introducing artificial viscosity. The first method reconstructs the velocity from the known flow divergence and from the true vorticity computed by means of a transport equation. The second method, which is much simpler and more efficient, subtracts a divergence-free correction from the velocity, such that the resulting velocity possesses the correct vorticity. We then successfully apply this method to solve a two-dimensional shock refraction problem, a problem which exhibits nonzero intrinsic vorticity.}

abstract = { We introduce a technique that makes every explicit Runge--Kutta (ERK) time stepping method invariant domain preserving and mass conservative when applied to high-order discretizations of the Cauchy problem associated with systems of nonlinear conservation equations. The key idea is that at each stage of the ERK scheme one computes a low-order update, a high-order update, both defined from the same intermediate stage, and then one applies the nonlinear, mass conservative limiting operator. The main advantage over the strong stability preserving (SSP) paradigm is more flexibility in the choice of the ERK scheme, thus allowing for less stringent restrictions on the time step. The technique is agnostic to the space discretization. It can be combined with continuous finite elements, discontinuous finite elements, and finite volume discretizations in space. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the theory. }

Phys. 167 (2001) 131–176]. Some modifications are made concerning a more suitable form of governing equations. They form a set of evolution equations for a local cobasis which is naturally related to the Almansi deformation tensor. Another novelty is that the equation of state is given in terms of invariants of the Almansi tensor in a form which separates hydrodynamic and shear effects. This model is compared with another hyperbolic non-conservative model which is widely used in engineering sciences. For this model we develop a Riemann solver and determine some reference solutions which are compared with the conservative model. The numerical results for different tests show good agreement of both models for waves of very small and very large amplitude. However, for waves of intermediate amplitude important discrepancies between results are clearly visible.}

These methods deal with extended systems of hyperbolic equations involving a non-conservative volume fraction equation and relaxation terms. Following the same theoretical frame, we derive here an Eulerian diffuse interface model for elastic solid-compressible fluid interactions in situations involving extreme deformations. Elastic effects are included following the Eulerian conservative formulation proposed in Godunov [16], Miller and Colella [23], Godunov and Romenskii [17], Plohr and Plohr [27] and Gavrilyuk et al. [14]. We apply first the Hamilton principle of stationary action to derive the conservative part of the model. The relaxation terms are then added which are compatible with the entropy inequality. In the limit of vanishing volume fractions the Euler equations of compressible fluids and a conservative hyperelastic model are recovered. It is solved by a unique hyperbolic solver valid at each mesh point (pure fluid, pure solid and mixture cell). Capabilities of the model and methods are illustrated on various tests of impacts of solids moving in an ambient compressible fluid.}

abstract = {A material is hyperelastic if the stress tensor is obtained by variation of the stored energy function. The corresponding 3D mathematical model of hyperelasticity written in the Eulerian coordinates represents a system of 14 conservative partial differential equations submitted to stationary differential constraints. A classical approach for numerical solving of such a 3D system is a geometrical splitting: the 3D system is split into three 1D systems along each spatial direction and solved then by using a Godunov type scheme. Each 1D system has 7 independent eigenfields corresponding to contact discontinuity, longitudinal waves and shear waves. The construction of the corresponding Riemann solvers is not an easy task even in the case of isotropic solids. Indeed, for a given specific energy it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to check its rank-one convexity which is a necessary and sufficient condition for hyperbolicity of the governing equations. In this paper, we consider a particular case where the specific energy is a sum of two terms. The first term is the hydrodynamic energy depending only on the density and the entropy, and the second term is the shear energy which is unaffected by the volume change. In this case a very simple criterion of hyperbolicity can be formulated. We propose then a new splitting procedure which allows us to find a numerical solution of each 1D system by solving successively three 1D sub-systems. Each sub-system is hyperbolic, if the full system is hyperbolic. Moreover, each sub-system has only three waves instead of seven, and the velocities of these waves are given in explicit form. The last property allows us to construct reliable Riemann solvers. Numerical 1D tests confirm the advantage of the new approach. A multi-dimensional extension of the splitting procedure is also proposed.}

Plastic transformations of solids are taken into account through a Maxwell type model. The specific energy of each solid is given in separable form: it is the sum of a hydrodynamic part of the energy depending only on the density and the entropy, and an elastic part of the energy which is unaffected by the volume change. It allows us to naturally pass to the fluid description in the limit of vanishing shear modulus. In spite of a large number of governing equations, the model has a quite simple mathematical structure: it is a duplication of a single visco-elastic model. The model is well posed both mathematically and thermodynamically: it is hyperbolic and compatible with the second law of thermodynamics. The resulting model can be applied in the situations involving an arbitrary number of fluids and solids. In particular, we show the ability of the model to describe spallation and penetration phenomena occurring during high velocity impacts.}

This model is constructed with an elegant approach where the specific energy is given in separable form. The system admits 14 eigenvalues with 7 characteristic eigenfields. The associated Riemann problem is not easy to solve because of the presence of 7 waves. The shear waves are very diffusive when dealing with the full system. In this paper, we use a splitting approach to solve the whole system using 3 sub-systems. This method reduces the diffusion of the shear waves while allowing to use a classical approximate Riemann solver. The multiphase model is obtained by adapting the discrete equations method. This approach involves an additional equation governing the evolution of a phase function relative to the presence of a phase in a cell. The system is integrated over a multiphase volume control. Finally, each phase admits its own equations system composed of three sub-systems. One and three dimensional test cases are presented.}

abstract = {While Eulerian schemes work well for most gas flows, they have been shown to admit nonphysical oscillations near some material interfaces. In contrast, Lagrangian schemes work well at multimaterial interfaces, but suffer from their own difficulties in problems with large deformations and vorticity characteristic of most gas flows. We believe that the most robust schemes will combine the best properties of Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes. In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for treating interfaces in Eulerian schemes that maintains a Heaviside profile of the density with no numerical smearing along the lines of earlier work and most Lagrangian schemes. We use a level set function to track the motion of a multimaterial interface in an Eulerian framework. In addition, the use of ghost cells (actually ghost nodes in our finite difference framework) and a new isobaric fix technique allows us to keep the density profile from smearing out, while still keeping the scheme robust and easy to program with simple extensions to multidimensions and multilevel time integration, e.g., Runge–Kutta methods. In contrast, previous methods used ill-advised dimensional splitting for multidimensional problems and suffered from great complexity when used in conjunction with multilevel time integrators.}

abstract = {The level set method was devised by S. Osher and J. A. Sethian (1988, J. Comput. Phys.79, 12–49) as a simple and versatile method for computing and analyzing the motion of an interface Γ in two or three dimensions. Γ bounds a (possibly multiply connected) region Ω. The goal is to compute and analyze the subsequent motion of Γ under a velocity field v. This velocity can depend on position, time, the geometry of the interface, and the external physics. The interface is captured for later time as the zero level set of a smooth (at least Lipschitz continuous) function ϕ (x, t); i.e., Γ(t)={x|ϕ(x, t)=0}. ϕ is positive inside Ω, negative outside Ω, and is zero on Γ(t). Topological merging and breaking are well defined and easily performed. In this review article we discuss recent variants and extensions, including the motion of curves in three dimensions, the dynamic surface extension method, fast methods for steady state problems, diffusion generated motion, and the variational level set approach. We also give a user's guide to the level set dictionary and technology and couple the method to a wide variety of problems involving external physics, such as compressible and incompressible (possibly reacting) flow, Stefan problems, kinetic crystal growth, epitaxial growth of thin films, vortex-dominated flows, and extensions to multiphase motion. We conclude with a discussion of applications to computer vision and image processing.}

abstract = {In this paper, we construct a class of second-order cell-centered Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes for the two-dimensional compressible Euler equations on quadrilateral meshes. This Lagrangian DG scheme is based on the physical coordinates rather than the fixed reference coordinates, hence it does not require studying the evolution of the Jacobian matrix for the flow mapping between the different coordinates. The conserved variables are solved directly, and the scheme can preserve the conservation property for mass, momentum and total energy. The strong stability preserving (SSP) Runge-Kutta (RK) method is used for the time discretization. Furthermore, there are two main contributions. Firstly, differently from the previous work, we design a new Lagrangian DG scheme which is truly second-order accurate for all the variables such as density, momentum, total energy, pressure and velocity, while the similar DG schemes in the literature may lose second-order accuracy for certain variables, as shown in numerical experiments. Secondly, as an extension and application, we develop a particular Lagrangian DG scheme in the cylindrical geometry, which is designed to be able to preserve one-dimensional spherical symmetry for all the linear polynomials in two-dimensional cylindrical coordinates when computed on an equal-angle-zoned initial grid. The distinguished feature is that it can maintain both the spherical symmetry and conservation properties, which is very important for many applications such as implosion problems. A series of numerical experiments in the two-dimensional Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates are given to demonstrate the good performance of the Lagrangian DG schemes in terms of accuracy, symmetry and non-oscillation.}

The method is discretization-independent provided elementary symmetry and skew-symmetry properties are satisfied by the scheme. The method is formally first-order accurate in space. Then, we introduce a series of higher-order methods. When these methods violate the invariant domain properties, they are corrected by a limiting technique that we call convex limiting. After limiting, the resulting methods satisfy all the invariant domain properties that are imposed by the user (see Theorem 7.24) and is formally high-order accurate. The two key novelties are that (i) limiting is done by enforcing bounds on quasiconcave functionals; (ii) the bounds that are enforced on the solution at each time step are necessarily satisfied by the low-order approximation.}

The method preserves all the known invariant domains of the Euler system: positivity of the density, positivity of the internal energy, and the local minimum principle on the specific entropy. The technique combines a first-order, invariant domain preserving, guaranteed maximum speed method using a graph viscosity (GMS-GV1) with an invariant domain violating, but entropy consistent, high-order method. Invariant domain preserving auxiliary states, naturally produced by the GMS-GV1 method, are used to define local bounds for the high-order method, which is then made invariant domain preserving via a convex limiting process. Numerical tests confirm the second-order accuracy of the new GMS-GV2 method in the maximum norm, where the 2 stands for second-order. The proposed convex limiting is generic and can be applied to other approximation techniques and other hyperbolic systems. }

abstract = {This paper presents a new high-order cell-centered Lagrangian scheme for two-dimensional compressible flow. The scheme uses a fully Lagrangian form of the gas dynamics equations, which is a weakly hyperbolic system of conservation laws. The system of equations is discretized in the Lagrangian space by discontinuous Galerkin method using a spectral basis. The vertex velocities and the numerical fluxes through the cell interfaces are computed consistently in the Eulerian space by virtue of an improved nodal solver. The nodal solver uses the HLLC approximate Riemann solver to compute the velocities of the vertex. The time marching is implemented by a class of TVD Runge–Kutta type methods. A new HWENO (Hermite WENO) reconstruction algorithm is developed and used as limiters for RKDG methods to maintain compactness of RKDG methods. The scheme is conservative for the mass, momentum and total energy. It can maintain high-order accuracy both in space and time, obey the geometrical conservation law, and achieve at least second order accuracy on quadrilateral meshes. Results of some numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and the robustness of the scheme.}

abstract = {We present a new cell-centered Lagrangian scheme on unstructured mesh for hyperelasticity. It is based on the recently proposed Glace scheme [11] for compressible gas dynamics. We show how to use the multiplicative decomposition of the gradient of deformation and the entropy property to derive the new scheme. We also prove the compatibility of this discretization with usual calculations of mass. Our motivation is to use hyperelasticity models for the study of finite plasticity, which is an extension of hypoelasticity to finite deformations. Hyperelasticity is a natural choice for extended models in solid mechanics, because of its mathematical structure which is a system of conservation laws with full rotational invariance. We study these properties for the Lagrangian system, and detail the various Eulerian formulations. We present several test problems, in 1D and 2D planar cases, which shows the capability of the scheme to capture complex shock-waves and to simulate solid–fluid problems. In this article, we use a special equation of state [21]. Its interest is twofold: we can calculate multi-dimensional plastic phenomenon (such as split shock in 1D uniaxial cases or particular shapes in Taylor test-case), and it gives interesting multi-dimensional test cases for hyperelastic planar schemes.}

The physical conservation laws for the momentum and total energy are discretized using a DG method based on linear Taylor expansions. Three different approaches are investigated for calculating the density variation over the element. The first approach evolves a Taylor expansion of the specific volume field. The second approach follows certain finite element methods and uses the strong mass conservation to calculate the density field at a location inside the element or on the element surface. The third approach evolves a Taylor expansion of the density field. The nodal velocity, and the corresponding forces, are explicitly calculated by solving a multidirectional approximate Riemann problem. An effective limiting strategy is presented that ensures monotonicity of the primitive variables. This new Lagrangian DG hydrodynamic method conserves mass, momentum, and total energy.

In standard ALE methods the new mesh from the rezone phase is obtained by moving grid nodes without changing connectivity of the mesh. Such rezone strategy has its limitation due to the fixed topology of the mesh. In our new method we allow connectivity of the mesh to change in rezone phase, which leads to general polygonal mesh and allows to follow Lagrangian features of the mesh much better than for standard ALE methods. Rezone strategy with reconnection is based on using Voronoi tessellation. We demonstrate performance of our new method on series of numerical examples and show it superiority in comparison with standard ALE methods without reconnection.}

abstract = {We present a new cell-centered multi-material arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) scheme to solve the compressible gas dynamics equations on two-dimensional unstructured grid. Our ALE method is of the explicit time-marching Lagrange plus remap type. Namely, it involves the following three phases: a Lagrangian phase wherein the flow is advanced using a cell-centered scheme; a rezone phase in which the nodes of the computational grid are moved to more optimal positions; a cell-centered remap phase which consists of interpolating conservatively the Lagrangian solution onto the rezoned grid. The multi-material modeling utilizes either concentration equations for miscible fluids or the Volume Of Fluid (VOF) capability with interface reconstruction for immiscible fluids. The main original feature of this ALE scheme lies in the introduction of a new mesh relaxation procedure which keeps the rezoned grid as close as possible to the Lagrangian one. In this formalism, the rezoned grid is defined as a convex combination between the Lagrangian grid and the grid resulting from condition number smoothing. This convex combination is constructed through the use of a scalar parameter which is a scalar function of the invariants of the Cauchy-Green tensor over the Lagrangian phase. Regarding the cell-centered remap phase, we employ two classical methods based on a partition of the rezoned cell in terms of its overlap with the Lagrangian cells. The first one is a simplified swept face-based method whereas the second one is a cell-intersection-based method. Our multi-material ALE methodology is assessed through several demanding two-dimensional tests. The corresponding numerical results provide a clear evidence of the robustness and the accuracy of this new scheme.},

abstract="SLIC is an alternating-direction method for the geometric approximation of fluid interfaces. It may be used in one, two, or three space dimensions, and it is characterized by the following features: (1) Fluid surfaces are represented locally for each mixed- fluid zone, and these surfaces are defined as a composition of one space dimensional components, one for each coordinate direction. (2) These onedimensional components are composed entirely of straight lines, either perpendicular to or parallel to that coordinate direction. (3) The one-dimensional surface approximations for a mixed fluid cell are completely determined by testing whether or not the various fluids in the mixed cell are present or absent in the zone just to the left and to the right in the coordinate direction under consideration. (4) Because of the completely one-dimensional nature of the SLIC interface description, it is relatively easy to advance the fluid surfaces correctly in time. With the SLIC fluid-surface definitions, it should be possible to incorporate any one space dimensional method for advancing contact discontinuities. This makes SLIC very practical for the numerical solution of fluid dynamical problems.",

The object of the present investigation is to determine the relations which must exist between the laws of the elasticity of any substance, whether gaseous, liquid, or solid, and those of the wave-like propagation of a finite longitudinal disturbance in that substance; in other words, of a disturbance consisting in displacements of particles along the direction of propagation, the velocity of displacement of the particles being so great that it is not to be neglected in comparison with the velocity of propagation. In particular, the investigation aims at ascertaining what conditions as to the transfer of heat from particle to particle must be fulfilled in order that a finite longitudinal disturbance may be propagated along a prismatic or cylindrical mass without loss of energy or change of type: the word type being used to denote the relation between the extent of disturbance at a given instant of a set of particles, and their respective undisturbed positions. The disturbed matter in these inquiries may be conceived to be contained in a straight tube of uniform cross-section and indefinite length. § 2. Mass-Velocity.—A convenient quantity in the present investigation, is what may be termed the mass-velocity or somatic velocity—that is to say, the mass of matter through which a disturbance is propagated in a unit of time while advancing along a prism of the sectional area unity. That mass-velocity will be denoted by m. }

Cosserat for compressible materials. The stored-energy function may be defined for a particular material in terms of the invariants of strain.

In the present paper, the equations are transformed into forms more suitable for carrying out such an explicit evaluation. As examples, the surface forces necessary to produce simple shear in a cuboid of either compressible or incompressible material and those required to produce simple torsion in a right-circular cylinder of incompressible material are derived. }

The main goal is the representation of the governing constitutive equations within the framework of the invariant theory which automatically fulfill the polyconvexity condition in the sense of Ball in order to guarantee the existence of minimizers. Based on the introduction of additional argument tensors, the so-called structural tensors, the free energies and the anisotropic stress response functions are represented by scalar-valued and tensor-valued isotropic tensor functions, respectively. In order to obtain various free energies to model specific problems which permit the matching of data stemming from experiments, we assume an additive structure. A variety of isotropic and anisotropic functions for transversely isotropic material behaviour are derived, where each individual term fulfills a priori the polyconvexity condition. The tensor generators for the stresses and moduli are evaluated in detail and some representative numerical examples are presented. Furthermore, we propose an extension to orthotropic symmetry.}

abstract = {In large strain elasticity the existence of minimizers is guaranteed if the variational functional to be minimized is sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous (s.w.l.s.) and coercive. Therefore, polyconvex functions which are always s.w.l.s. are usually considered. For isotropic as well as for transversely isotropic and orthotropic materials constitutive functions that are polyconvex already exist. The main goal of this contribution is to provide a new method for the construction of polyconvex hyperelastic models for more general anisotropy classes. The fundamental idea is the introduction of positive definite second-order structural tensors G=HHT encoding the anisotropies of the underlying crystal. These tensors can be viewed as a push-forward of a cartesian metric of a fictitious reference configuration to the real reference configuration. Here the driving transformations H in the push-forward operation are mappings of the cartesian base vectors of the fictitious configuration onto crystallographic motivated base vectors. Restrictions of this approach are based on the polyconvexity condition as well as on the usage of second-order structural tensors and pointed out in detail.}

abstract = {A new SUPG-stabilized formulation for Lagrangian hydrodynamics of materials satisfying Mie–Grüneisen equation of state is proposed. It allows the use of simplex-type (triangular/tetrahedral) meshes as well as the more commonly used brick-type (quadrilateral/hexahedral) meshes. The proposed method yields a globally conservative formulation, in which equal-order interpolation (P1 or Q1 isoparametric finite elements) is applied to velocities, displacements, and pressure. As a direct consequence, and in contrast to traditional cell-centered multidimensional hydrocode implementations, the proposed formulation allows a natural representation of the pressure gradient on element interiors. The SUPG stabilization involves additional design requirements, specific to the Lagrangian formulation. A discontinuity capturing operator in the form of a Noh-type viscosity with artificial heat flux is used to preserve stability and smoothness of the solution in shock regions. A set of challenging shock hydrodynamics benchmark tests for the Euler equations of gas dynamics in one and two space dimensions is presented. In the two-dimensional case, computations performed on quadrilateral and triangular grids are analyzed and compared. These results indicate that the new formulation is a promising technology for hydrocode applications.}

abstract = {A new method based on a continuous, piece-wise linear approximation of the equations for Lagrangian shock hydrodynamics is presented. Numerical instabilities are controlled by a stabilizing operator derived using the paradigm of the variational multiscale analysis. Encouraging numerical comparisons with existing methods in the case of quadrilateral and hexahedral elements indicate that the proposed method is capable of preventing hourglass patterns in the solution, while maintaining accuracy in regions of smooth flow. The proposed approach satisfies Galilean invariance properties and hinges upon the interpretation of the Lagrangian shock hydrodynamics equations as a system of nonlinear wave equations. A specific implementation in terms of a predictor/multi-corrector version of the mid-point time integrator guarantees global conservation of mass, momentum, and total energy for each iterate. Stability and formal order of accuracy are investigated applying the von Neumann analysis to the linearized shock hydrodynamics equations in one dimension. This approach yields tight bounds for stable time-step estimation, formal second-order accuracy of the method in time and space, and valuable indications on the choice of the most appropriate values for the stabilization parameters present in the formulation.}

abstract = {Our goal is to present a simple interface-capturing approach for barotropic two-fluid flow problems in more than one space dimension. We use the compressible Euler equations in isentropic form as a model system with the thermodynamic property of each fluid component characterized by the Tait equation of state. The algorithm uses a non-isentropic form of the Tait equation of state as a basis to the modeling of the numerically induced mixing between two different barotropic fluid components within a grid cell. Similar to our previous work for multicomponent problems, see [J. Comput. Phys. 171 (2001) 678] and references cited therein, we introduce a mixture type of the model system that consists of the full Euler equations for the basic conserved variables and an additional set of evolution equations for the problem-dependent material quantities and also the approximate location of the interfaces. A standard high-resolution method based on a wave-propagation formulation is employed to solve the proposed model system with the dimensional-splitting technique incorporated in the method for multidimensional problems. Several numerical results are presented in one, two, and three space dimensions that show the feasibility of the method as applied to a reasonable class of practical problems without introducing any spurious oscillations in the pressure near the smeared material interfaces.}

abstract = {Based on the total Lagrangian kinematical description, a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization of the gas dynamics equations is developed for two-dimensional fluid flows on general unstructured grids. Contrary to the updated Lagrangian formulation, which refers to the current moving configuration of the flow, the total Lagrangian formulation refers to the fixed reference configuration, which is usually the initial one. In this framework, the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of the kinematical and the physical variables are related by means of the Piola transformation. Here, we describe a cell-centered high-order DG discretization of the physical conservation laws. The geometrical conservation law, which governs the time evolution of the deformation gradient, is solved by means of a finite element discretization. This approach allows to satisfy exactly the Piola compatibility condition. Regarding the DG approach, it relies on the use of a polynomial space approximation which is spanned by a Taylor basis. The main advantage in using this type of basis relies on its adaptability regardless the shape of the cell. The numerical fluxes at the cell interfaces are computed employing a node-based solver which can be viewed as an approximate Riemann solver. We present numerical results to illustrate the robustness and the accuracy up to third-order of our DG method. First, we show its ability to accurately capture geometrical features of a flow region employing curvilinear grids. Second, we demonstrate the dramatic improvement in symmetry preservation for radial flows.}

abstract = {One of the main issues in the field of numerical schemes is to ally robustness with accuracy. Considering gas dynamics, numerical approximations may generate negative density or pressure, which may lead to nonlinear instability and crash of the code. This phenomenon is even more critical using a Lagrangian formalism, the grid moving and being deformed during the calculation. Furthermore, most of the problems studied in this framework contain very intense rarefaction and shock waves. In this paper, the admissibility of numerical solutions obtained by high-order finite-volume-scheme-based methods, such as the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, the essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) and the weighted ENO (WENO) finite volume schemes, is addressed in the one-dimensional Lagrangian gas dynamics framework. After briefly recalling how to derive Lagrangian forms of the 1D gas dynamics system of equations, a discussion on positivity-preserving approximate Riemann solvers, ensuring first-order finite volume schemes to be positive, is then given. This study is conducted for both ideal gas and non-ideal gas equations of state (EOS), such as the Jones–Wilkins–Lee (JWL) EOS or the Mie–Grüneisen (MG) EOS, and relies on two different techniques: either a particular definition of the local approximation of the acoustic impedances arising from the approximate Riemann solver, or an additional time step constraint relative to the cell volume variation. Then, making use of the work presented in [89], [90], [22], this positivity study is extended to high-orders of accuracy, where new time step constraints are obtained, and proper limitation is required. Through this new procedure, scheme robustness is highly improved and hence new problems can be tackled. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods. This paper is the first part of a series of two. The whole analysis presented here is extended to the two-dimensional case in [85], and proves to fit a wide range of numerical schemes in the literature, such as those presented in [19], [64], [15], [82], [84].}

The density, momentum, and total energy (ρ,ρu,E) are approximated with conservative higher-order Taylor expansions over the element and are limited toward a piecewise constant field near discontinuities using a limiter. Two new limiting methods are presented for enforcing the bounds on the primitive variables of density, velocity, and specific internal energy (ρ,u,e). The nodal velocity, and the corresponding forces, are calculated by solving an approximate Riemann problem at the element nodes. An explicit second-order method is used to temporally advance the solution. This new Lagrangian DG hydrodynamic method conserves mass, momentum, and total energy. 1D Cartesian coordinates test problem results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and convergence order of the new DG method with the new limiters.}
