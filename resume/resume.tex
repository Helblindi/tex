\begin{rSection}{EXPERIENCE}

\textbf{Graduate Teaching/Research Assistant} \hfill Aug 2019 - Dec 2025\\
Texas A\&M University \hfill \textit{College Station, TX}\\
{\bf Advisor: Jean-Luc Guermond}
 \begin{itemize}
    % \itemsep -3pt {} 
    \item Developed a finite element method for the equations of Lagrangian hydrodynamics that achieves high-order accuracy while preserving essential physical invariants, ensuring robustness in challenging flow regimes.
    % \item Implemented novel techniques in C++ within MFEM, validated through convergence studies, benchmark problems, and HPC runs on the Whistler cluster.
    \item Collaborated across mathematics, physics, and engineering teams; presented findings at SIAM CSE, USNCCM, and other national conferences.
    \item Served as Instructor of Record for Math 140, independently leading classroom instruction, developing assignments and exams, and evaluating student performance.
 \end{itemize}
\vspace{1em}
\textbf{Graduate Student Intern} \hfill May 2022 - September 2023\\
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory \hfill \textit{Livermore,  CA} \\
{\bf Mentor: Vladimir Tomov}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Augmented high-order Lagrangian hydrodynamics codes in C++/MFEM with an invariant-domain preserving Lagrangian finite element method, ensuring physics-consistent robustness validated with benchmark tests.

    \item Modified an MFEM discontinuous Galerkin advection solver for use with continuous finite element discretizations, extending code capabilities and supporting broader benchmarking.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Graduate Student Intern} \hfill Jan 2019 - April 2022\\
Nevada National Security Site \hfill \textit{North Las Vegas, NV} \\
{\bf Mentors: Cleat Zeiler, Marylesa Howard, Daniel Champion}
 \begin{itemize}
    % \itemsep -3pt {} 
     \item Developed and trained deep learning models in Python/TensorFlow to reconstruct clipped seismic waveforms, improving signal fidelity and enabling more accurate seismic event detection.
    \item Designed a Python-based multilateration algorithm using geophone array data to geolocate seismic signal sources with improved accuracy, supporting rapid deployment for field missions.
